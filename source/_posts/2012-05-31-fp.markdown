Python was invented as a language for a education, at least partially.
And now this language is quite popular and used by many companies and people.
And also Python influenced on many languages like for example Ruby or Groovy.

But in functional world we still don't have own Python, a simple language with the dynamic typization and
less noisy syntax. You say Scheme, SICP cources and etc. But for some people LISP's syntax isn't a synonym for
less noisy.

I think, we need a simple functional language with the dynamic typization, a compact syntax without noise.
