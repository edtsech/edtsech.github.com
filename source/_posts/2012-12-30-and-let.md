In Clojure we have two nice macros [if-let](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/if-let)
and [when-let](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/when-let).

``` clj
(if-let [a ...]
  (inc a)
  0)

; or we can use `when-let` when we don't have `else` branch

(when-let [a ...]
  (inc a))
```

but unfortunately we can't pass more than two binding forms to 
these macros, and emulate the behavior of Scheme's [and-let](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref/and_002dlet_002a-_0028SRFI-2_0029.html) 
or kind of maybe monad.

I mean smth like that:

``` clj 
(and-let [a 1 b 2] 
         (+ a b)) ; => 3

(and-let [a 1 b nil]
         (+ a b)) ; => nil
```

It isn't really hard to implement it:

``` clj
(defmacro and-let [bindings expr]
  (if (seq bindings)
    `(if-let [~(first bindings) ~(second bindings)]
       (and-let ~(drop 2 bindings) ~expr))
     expr))

(use 'clojure.walk)
(macroexpand-all '(and-let [a 1 b 2]
                           (+ a b)))

; (let* [temp__3971__auto__ 1] 
;   (if temp__3971__auto__ 
;     (let* [a temp__3971__auto__] 
;       (let* [temp__3971__auto__ 2] 
;         (if temp__3971__auto__ 
;           (let* [b temp__3971__auto__]  
;             (+ a b)) 
;           nil))) 
;     nil))

```

But we could do some improvements here: check count of binding form (should be even), 
implement `else` clause, probably find a better name, implementation.

I'm not really sure about `else` clause, it can be very useful, but it sounds weird to have `else` part
with `and-let` name. I thought about `if-let*` and `when-let*` names, it looks idiomatic for other Lisps
but not for Clojure I think.

I think Clojure way, will be - change a behavior of `if-let` and `when-let` macros in Clojure to support
more than two binding forms, because `let` already does it.

Wdyt?

PS. Another option is use the maybe monad from `algo.monads` but it's extra dependency for relatively
small amount of code (if you don't plan use monads really often) and slightly different behavior.

## Peace!
