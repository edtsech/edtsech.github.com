### Groovy - 2003

Object-oriented with first-class functions support.

### Scala - 2003
"True" object-oriented and functional.

### Fantom - 2005

Object-oriented with first-class functions, actors model and immutable data structures.

### F# - 2005

Influenced by OCaml, multi-paradigm language, both functional and object-oriented.

### Clojure - 2007

Only functional programming paradigm is supported.

### Go - 2009

???

### Lambdas in Java - 2013

My point is that more and more languages support functional paradigm.

## Peace!
